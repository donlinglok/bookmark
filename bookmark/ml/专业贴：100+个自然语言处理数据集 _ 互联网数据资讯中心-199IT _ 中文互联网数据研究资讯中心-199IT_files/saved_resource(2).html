<p>This represents all publicly available Reddit submissions from January 2006 - August 31, 2015).  </p>

<p><strong>Several notes on this data:</strong></p>

<p>Data is complete from <em>January 01, 2008 thru August 31, 2015</em>.  Partial data is available for years 2006 and 2007.  The reason for this is that the id's used when Reddit was just a baby were scattered a bit -- but I am making an attempt to grab all data from 2006 and 2007 and will make a supplementary upload for that data once I'm satisfied that I've found all data that is available.</p>

<p>I have added a key called "retrieved_on" with a unix timestamp for each submission in this dataset.  If you're doing analysis on scores, late August data may still be too young and you may want to wait for the August and September additions that I will make available in October.  </p>

<p>This dataset represents approximately 200 million submission objects with score data, author, title, self_text, media tags and all other attributes available via the Reddit API.  </p>

<p>This dataset will go nicely with the full Reddit Comment Corpus that I released a couple months ago.  The link_id from each comment corresponds to the id key in each of the submission objects in this dataset.  </p>

<p><strong>Next steps</strong></p>

<p>I will provide monthly updates for both comment data and submission data going forward.  Each new month usually adds over 50 million comments and approximately 10 million submissions (this fluctuates a bit).  Also, I will split this large file up into individual months in the next few days.  </p>

<p><strong>Better Reddit Search</strong></p>

<p>My goal now is to take all of this data and create a usable Reddit search function that uses comment data to vastly improve search results.  Reddit's current search generally doesn't do much more than look at keywords in the submission title, but the new search I am building will use the approximately 2 billion comments to improve results.  For instance, if someone does a search for Einstein, the current search will return results where the submission title or self text contain the word Einstein.  Using comments, the search I am building will be able to see how often Einstein is mentioned in the body of comments and weight those submissions accordingly.  </p>

<p>An example of this would be if someone posted a question in <a href="http://www.199it.com/r/askscience" target="_blank">/r/askscience</a> "How is the general theory of relativity different than the special theory of relativity?"  Many of the comments would contain "Einstein" in the comment bodies, thereby making that submission relevant when someone does a search for "Einstein."  This is just one of the methods for improving Reddit's search function.  I hope to have a Beta search in place in early December.  </p>
